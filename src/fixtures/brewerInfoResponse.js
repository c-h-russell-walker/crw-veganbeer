I got sent to an answer machine and basically read what you suggest asking in the email. I got a call back a couple of days later saying that they had confirmed with the brewery that no animal products are present in the product or processing and that it was safe to list as vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email about Moosehead:\r\nThank you for your inquiry. We are happy to say that we do not use animal products in any of our brands of beer. The ingredients are malt, corn, hops and water.
